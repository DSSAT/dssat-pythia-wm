Hypothetical climate scenarios can be imposed by the modeler to study the effects of climate change on crop yield and production and to pinpoint hotspots for climate adaptation studies. Three weather input variables can be modified to mimic the effects of climate change: temperature, rainfall, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels. These three weather variables affect plant growth processes which often interact in complex ways. Combinations of temperature increase, precipitation change, and CO<sub>2</sub> increase can be set for a particular location, climate scenario, and Global Climate Model.

1. Temperatures can be modified by selecting the **“Temperature offset”** option. The value selected will be used to increase (or decrease) maximum and minimum daily temperatures in the model. Plants grow optimally within a range of temperatures which is dependent on the species. Above or below that optimum range, plant growth is stunted. Temperature also affects the rate of progression of plant development. Depending on the environment and the species, increases (or decreases) in temperature can have a beneficial or a detrimental effect on crop yields.

	User selections range from “-1” (1 degree C decrease in temperatures) to “+5” (5 degree C increase in temperatures). 

2. As in the sensitivity model, the **“Rainfall multiplier”** option allows a user to increase or decrease the amount of rainfall during a simulation to mimic effects of drought or higher than normal rainfall. Historical observations of daily rainfall are multiplied by this amount and used as input to the DSSAT model. Optimum soil water conditions improve plant growth, with adverse effects occurring for both too much and too little water.

	User selections of the rainfall multiplier range from 0.25 to 2.0.  

3. The **“CO2 value”** option is used to set the value of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> for the model simulations. CO<sub>2</sub> generally has a fertilization effect on plant growth, to varying degrees for different species. 

	User selections of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> range from 400 ppm, representing 2015 values up to 800 ppm, representing an end-of-century high emissions scenario.
