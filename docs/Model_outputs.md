DSSAT model outputs are available from two sources in Causemos:
- From DSSAT **model simulations** directly from Causemos, and  
- From DSSAT **datasets**, which have been pre-run and archived for access from Causemos. 


## Outputs from DSSAT models ##

Model outputs from simulations are used to generate data which can be used for analysis, mapping, and data exploration. In the WM DSSAT configuration, four output variables are exposed: 
1.	**crop yield**, a measure of the crop productivity per unit area (kg/ha), 
2.	**crop production**, the amount of crop produced. This is the product of yield times the area harvested (t), 
3.	**amount of fertilizer applied**, the amount of elemental N in fertilizer applied for crop production (t). This is useful for when fertilizer incentives are being analyzed. 
4.	**area of crop failure**, defined as area in hectares for which the crop yield was less than 200 kg/ha (ha).

Each of these variables is computed for each geographic location, or pixel, in the geospatial simulation and for each of 36 years of historical weather data. Each value is associated with a timestamp year and a location (latitude and longitude or administrative unit). 

New model simulations can be generated by the user as needed for analyses. See [DSSAT Model Types](Model_types.md) for more information on the user controls for these simulations.

## Outputs from DSSAT stored as Datasets in Dojo ##

A richer set of DSSAT model outputs have been archived as datasets registered in Causemos. The archived datasets allow for deeper interpretation of model outputs, but these datasets cannot be modified with new simulations. Additional variables available only through the datasets require complex aggregation algorithms (e.g., they cannot be simply summed or averaged) and so they were pre-simulated, aggregated, and stored in DSSAT datasets along with some summarizing box plots. The dataset variables include all the variables listed for the model simulations above plus two additional variables:
1.	**crop per drop**, the crop yield divided by the amount of water applied as rainfall and irrigation (kg ha<sup>-1</sup> mm<sup>-1</sup>). This is a measure of the water use efficiency of a crop.
2.	**crop per person** is the crop production in an area divided by the number of people in that area (kg/person). This is a useful measurement of how well an area might feed itâ€™s people. For urban areas, the number is not as useful a measure, as there are more people with fewer farms. It does not account for imported food or food that is transported from one area to another.
