Hypothetical scenarios can be set within Causemos to modify baseline conditions (i.e., current farmer practices) to study "what-if" scenarios or to look at the sensitivity of the system to these variables. In the WM DSSAT Sensitivity model, three input values can be modified to create scenarios:

1.	Fertilizer inputs can be modified over a range of values by selecting the **“Fertilizer N increase”** option. This allows a user to increase the amount of fertilizer applied to fields above the current farmer practice. This is useful for fertilizer subsidy investigations, for example. 

	Values of fertilizer N increase are limited to a few options between zero (the current farmer practice) and +200 kg[N] above current farmer practice. These additional fertilizer amounts are expressed as kilograms of elemental nitrogen per hectare.

2. Planting dates can be modified by using the **“Planting date offset”** option. Planting dates are simulated in DSSAT using a planting window. On the first day within the planting window for which soil moisture and temperature conditions are within suitable ranges, planting occurs in the model. These planting date "rules" allow planting to occur, within the specified window, after the seasonal rains begin, which may vary from year to year. Baseline planting windows were set by the expert modeler, but these can be shifted by the user to explore early or late planting options. 

	Planting date offset values, in days, are limited to a few options between -60 (i.e., 60 days prior to current farmer planting dates) to +60 (i.e., 60 days after current farmer planting dates). 

3. The **“Rainfall multiplier”** option allows a user to increase or decrease the amount of rainfall during a simulation to mimic effects of drought or higher than normal rainfall. 

	User selection options include a range of values between 0.25 (25% of recorded rainfall amounts) through 2.0 (double the recorded rainfall amounts).
