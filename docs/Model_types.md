Three types of DSSAT models are available to generate new simulations from Causemos. 
1.	The [**DSSAT sensitivity analysis model**](Model_sensitivity.md) includes user selections for modifying fertilizer amounts, planting dates, and rainfall. 
2.	The [**DSSAT climate change model**](Model_climate_change.md) can be used to modify weather variables to mimic the effects of climate change. The user can select modficiations for temperature, rainfall, and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
3.	The [**DSSAT forecast model**](Model_Forecast) is used to estimate yield and production for the current cropping season.
