The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT, dssat.net) is a crop modeling system for prediction of crop yields, crop growth dynamics, and soil water and chemical processes. There are many modeling and analytical components included in DSSAT but only a few, described herein, have been exposed to user access in the World Modeling (WM) system.

The following figure illustrates a sample DSSAT container as implemented on Dojo for WM. In this example, the DSSAT container includes data and model components for modeling maize in Ethiopia under baseline (current practice) conditions and a few options for perturbing those baseline conditions. When a general modeler makes selections, simulations are performed on Dojo using the DSSAT-pythia modeling framework and the DSSAT-Cropping System model (CSM). The general modeler’s selections are encoded into a DSSAT-pythia configuration file and metadata describing the resulting dataset(s).
